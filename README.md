## General info
"Classmates meet" is a web app that is designed for students who are enrolled in the same class. The purpose of the app is to help these students connect with each other by allowing them to add themselves to a student list if they are interested in meeting with their classmates.

To use the app, students must first register and sign in using their credentials. Once they have logged in, they will be able to view a list of their classmates along with their first name, last name, email, city, and state. This information will be displayed on a web page that is accessible to all registered users of the app.

In addition to viewing the list of classmates, students are also able to update and delete their own student record. This means they can modify their personal information (such as their email address or city) or remove themselves from the student list entirely.

Finally, the app provides a logout feature, which allows students to securely log out of the app when they are finished using it. This is an important security measure to ensure that their personal information is protected and that no one else can access their account.

Overall, "Classmates meet" is a web app designed to help students in the same class connect with each other by providing a platform for them to add themselves to a student list and view the information of their classmates.
